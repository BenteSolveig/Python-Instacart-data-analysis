# Python-Instacart-data-analysis
As an online grocery store thriving on its app-based platform, Instacart aims to enhance its sales strategies. This project involves an initial data analysis to unveil key insights, with a focus on exploring sales patterns and suggesting segmentation strategies based on specified criteria.

**Key Questions**
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
